Project Finger
--------------

An android application that performs gesture combination lock. The user can create a gesture "password", where each "digit" is a combination of a gesture representation of 0-5 and the position of the hand relative to the frame (corners, edge and center).

This is my first Android application, developed for an assignment for my Visual Interfaces to Computers class. It is written with Java. The gesture detection is done via the Java interfaces to `OpenCV`.
